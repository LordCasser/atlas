# Atlas Roadmap

This roadmap tracks **current and future work only**.

## 1. Current release focus: V1 release

Goal: ship a stable first version where CLI and MCP tools are usable by end users and agents against a local repository.

### 1.1 Packaging and installation

- Publish or document a repeatable release build flow for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Document verified platform matrix, minimum Rust version, and feature choices.
- Decide whether V1 is distributed as source-only, release binaries, or both.
- Add release notes / changelog entry for the first public version.

### 1.2 User-facing documentation

- Keep `README.md` as the primary user entry point: installation, quickstart, CLI, MCP, architecture, language support, limitations.
- Keep `docs/trace-contract.md` as the stable reference for trace JSON output.
- Keep `docs/architecture.md` as the single authoritative architecture document.

### 1.3 MCP production hardening

- Freeze V1 MCP tool naming: short names without `atlas_` prefix. ✅ Done.
- Freeze V1 tool schemas and document argument requirements.
- Add machine-readable version metadata for MCP clients.
- Finalize graph snapshot refresh semantics.
- Keep all MCP outputs bounded and ensure truncation is visible in the response.

### 1.4 CLI and database release gates

- Ensure `atlas doctor` exposes release-relevant state.
- Compatibility: V1 schema with no migration chain (direct DDL changes).
- Make `.atlas/` cleanup and rebuild guidance explicit.
- Keep JSON output stable for scripted use.
- Publish verified performance baselines.

### 1.5 Release smoke tests

```bash
cargo test
cargo test -p atlas-cli --features all-languages
cargo test -p atlas-cli --features mcp
cargo test -p atlas-cli --features "all-languages,mcp"
```

## 2. Completed work

### 2.1 DataflowFull + persistent summary layer ✅

All 14 languages are now at `DataflowFull` level. The current schema added 4 persistent summary tables (`function_summaries`, `summary_param_reaches`, `summary_return_sources`, `summary_call_arg_sources`) with `CrossFunctionBridge` for ArgToParam/ReturnToCall interprocedural bridges.

> **Known gap**: CFG builder (`cfg_builder.rs`) has placeholder `walk_if`/`walk_loop` implementations — if/else sub-blocks and loop bodies are not traversed. This means CFG output is structurally incomplete for conditional and loop branches. The `DataflowFull` label reflects the dataflow/lexical/reference pipeline, not CFG completeness.

### 2.2 Lazy Index (three phases) ✅

- **P0: Scope Index** — `--include`/`--scope`/`--exclude` range-limited indexing.
- **P1: Manifest Extraction** — `ExtractionMode::Manifest` for lightweight top-level symbol extraction.
- **P2: Lazy Structural** — on-demand structural extraction via `LazyStructuralService`.

### 2.3 Workspace/crate split ✅

Project split into `atlas-engine` facade, engine internal crates, `atlas-mcp`, and `atlas-cli`.

### 2.4 Performance optimizations ✅

P0-P7 optimizations completed: PhaseTimings, hash-based dirty-set, thread-local parsers, batch DB writes, GlobalSymbolIndex, Rayon parallel edges, on-demand dataflow/CFG, language-capability-driven skip.

### 2.5 MCP tool consolidation ✅

All tools use short names (no `atlas_` prefix). 27 tools registered.

## 3. Trace and language capability work

### 3.1 Capability alignment

- Keep `language_capabilities` and `atlas doctor` aligned with actual compiled features.
- For each language, maintain explicit limitations and confidence floors.
- Ensure unsupported or partial trace queries return diagnostics rather than silent empty results.

### 3.2 Path-level validation

Continue expanding end-to-end smoke tests for all languages.

## 4. Graph and performance evolution

### 4.1 Graph/dataflow/CFG loading

- Keep symbol graph snapshots as the main graph-query accelerator.
- Load dataflow and CFG facts by file/function/slice when trace queries need them.
- Avoid unbounded in-memory loading for fine-grained dataflow and CFG facts.

### 4.2 Performance targets

- Keep `docs/performance.md` updated with release baselines.
- Track index time, DB size, memory use, and MCP query latency.
- Prioritize resolution and DB write bottlenecks.

## 5. Public API stabilization

`atlas-engine` already exists as a facade crate. The next step is API stabilization:

- Define the minimal supported public API surface.
- Avoid leaking internal schema details unnecessarily.
- Document feature flags and language availability.
- Keep CLI/MCP as consumers of the same engine behavior.
- Lock trace response contracts before promising downstream compatibility.

## 6. Future product lines

### 6.1 Atlas mainline

- Indexing and incremental sync.
- Symbol graph and dependency graph.
- Search/context/impact analysis.
- Variable provenance and caller-path tracing.
- MCP-driven agent context.

### 6.2 Corpus (not in V1)

A multi-version source corpus system for Linux/U-Boot/BusyBox-style repositories remains a separate future product line:

```text
Atlas:  project-relative path + local workspace DB
Corpus: git blob + version/tag/path mappings
```

## 7. Not planned for V1

- Full compiler-grade type checking.
- Full C/C++ preprocessing, template instantiation, overload resolution, or alias analysis.
- Full Python dynamic/runtime symbol resolution.
- Java Maven/Gradle/classpath completeness.
- Automatic vulnerability scanning, taint rules, finding generation, or SAST product features.
- Multi-version source corpus indexing.
